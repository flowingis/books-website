    <h2>The bridge from PHP to refactoring techniques</h2>
    <p>Pro PHP Refactoring is about improving the quality of the PHP code you write by identifying typical anti-patterns known as bad smells and addressing them by means of solid and safe step-by-step techniques.</p>
    <p>This book is a bridge connecting the PHP language with the refactoring techniques popularized by Martin Fowler and the agile community. The book starts with popular refactorings applied to PHP, then goes on to demonstrate the use of refactoring tools, techniques, and an extended example demonstrating how to refactor an entire application.</p>
    <p>Too many companies and freelancers depend on old high-value PHP soft- ware that gets more obsolete every day because of its difficult maintainability. The reasons for this may be badly designed software, or legacy code developed by a single cowboy programmer, or even the code belonging to the old proce- dural times of PHP, when it was not yet object-oriented. This book provides an intermediate or advanced PHP developer with some effective tools to distill the best quality out of existing lines of code.</p>
    <p>The reader will learn:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What refactoring is and why you need to refactor code</li>
        <li>What test-first development is and why you need to test your code</li>
        <li>How to write unit and functional tests with PHPUnit and Selenium Remote Control (RC)</li>
        <li>How to detect bad smells in PHP code, and refactor them using automated tests</li>
        <li>How to refactor a large procedural application affected by many bad smells</li>
    </ul>
    <p>During the last several years, we learned that code can always be improved and that there is always room for a better design. This book will show you how you can also improve your code and your design as well as assist you in your day to-day work with a complete and reliable reference.</p>

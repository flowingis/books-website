    <h2>The bridge from PHP to refactoring techniques</h2>
    <p>Pro PHP Refactoring is about improving the quality of the PHP code you write by identifying typical anti-patterns known as bad smells and addressing them by means of solid and safe step-by-step techniques.</p>
    <p>This book is a bridge connecting the PHP language with the refactoring techniques popularized by Martin Fowler and the agile community. The book starts with popular refactorings applied to PHP, then goes on to demonstrate the use of refactoring tools, techniques, and an extended example demonstrating how to refactor an entire application.</p>

        <p>This is probably the best chapter (chapter 15) in this book, and in actually most books I’ve read, that demonstrates the refactoring pattern.  I’m thoroughly impressed.</p>
